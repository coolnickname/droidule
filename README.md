Droidule
=======

Unofficial Android app for Xedule using the unofficial [Xedule API](https://git.yildri.nl/Baconator/xedule-api), based on [Xedroid](https://github.com/Darkwater/xedroid) by Sam Lakerveld.


The Differenceâ„¢
=======
### Changes
- Changed the star icon to home icon because I think it's more fitting.
- Fixed a lot of deprecated methods.
- Lots of refactoring to my preference (Still kinda WIP).

### New Features ðŸŽ‰
- A fancy theming engine with currently 3 themes. Screenshots coming soon ;)
- Opening a schedule during the weekend will now show next week's schedule (Like Xedule does).
- The first opened schedule will now be marked as the default (starred) until changed

Building
--------

1. Clone repository.
2. Run `./gradlew installDebug` to install a debug build on any connected devices.

Note: `git describe --tags` is used for version number. Make sure `git` is accessible like that and your local
repository has the correct tags set. Try `git pull --tags` if something goes wrong.
